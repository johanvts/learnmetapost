* Getting started
** What is MetaPost?
MetaPost is a 2D-graphics description language for specifying vector graphics.
It is also a piece of software, the MetaPost compiler, that renders such a specification to image files.

MetaPost is especially suited for describing graphics in a mathematical way and has a powerful build in
equation solver that enables this.

MetaPost is heavily inspired by the Metafont language, which was designed to define
fonts for TeX, and Metapost is often used in integration with LaTeX, but in this course we will
focus on using MetaPost as stand-alone software.

** In this course

This course will cover the basics of installing and using metapost. After completing the course you will be able to 
produce advanced graphics like this. However this course is meant as an introduction and there are plenty of features of metapost we
will not cover, at the end of the course we will discuss sources for further learning.

** Prerequisites

We will need a few things before we can start using MetaPost:

1. A terminal of some sort. I will be using Powershell on Windows but really any shell/terminal/command prompt should be fine.
2. A plain text editor, I'll be using notepad.
3. A place to work. MetaPost will generate a few files, it is easier to see whats going on if you start your work in an empty folder.
 
** Installing metapost
MetaPost is often used in conjunction with LaTeX and many TeX distributions include metapost. The simplest way to
get metapost installed on your computer is to install one of the widely avaiable latex distributions that include it. 
Here we will use MikTex, you can find a link in the description.

https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex

Once you have MikTex installed you should be able to open your command prompt or terminal and issue the command mpost(.exe).
You should see a response like this:

{{< figure src="/images/run_mpost.PNG" title="Running MetaPost from Powershell in Windows Terminal." >}}

You are looking at the MetaPost compiler, waiting for you to input some metapost code.
Normally we will be passing a source file along to the compiler with our code, but you could type it directly in here.

You can press ctrl-X to exit the metapost compiler.

As you can see, we will be using metapost 2.0 for this course, if you have an older version some things might not work as expected
so please check that your version number is at least 2.0.

** Hello world
Now that MetaPost is installed lets create our first figure.

Create a text file, lets call it "HelloWorld.mp". We typically use the .mp extension for MetaPost files.
Copy the text below into you file, we will be going through it line by line.

#+BEGIN_SRC
outputformat := "png";

beginfig(1)
label("Hello World",origin);
endfig

end
#+END_SRC


By default MetaPost produces encapsulated post-script files, this format is great for including images in a larger file when you are working with
LaTeX, but since we will be using MetaPost stand-alone for this course we will prefer to produce PNG output.
To instruct MetaPost to output PNG our first command will be:

#+BEGIN_SRC
outputformat := "png"
#+END_SRC

This is an example of setting an internal variable, 'outputformat' is a variable that we wil not be using in our code, but rather it is used
to configure the MetaPost interpreter. You can also set it to "svg" to generate svg output.

To begin a figure we write

#+BEGIN_SRC
beginfig(1)
#+END_SRC

The 1 is a name for our figure, by default metapost will include this number as the file extension of the figure output.
To write some text on our figure we can use a *label*.

#+BEGIN_SRC
label("Hello World",origin);
#+END_SRC
as you can probably guess this places the text "Hello World" at origin (i.e. at the (0,0) coordinate).
Now we end the figure, and since we don't want to include more figures in this file we end the file as well with end
#+BEGIN_SRC
endfig
end
#+END_SRC
generally lines are terminated with ;, but its not necessary for ending the figure.
Save the file and return to your terminal.
If MetaPost is correctly installed you should be able to issue the command.
#+BEGIN_SRC
mpost.exe HelloWorld.mp
#+END_SRC
Hopefully you will see an output similar to this:

{{< figure src="/images/helloWorld.PNG" title="Asking MetaPost to process our first figure." >}}

Congratulations, you just produced the file "HelloWorld.1". 
This will be your figure, open it op and have a look. You might have to rename it to .png to make it recognisable as a PNG image, we will look into this in the
exercises.

{{< figure src="/images/HelloWorld.1" title="Our first figure." >}}

You will notice that the text we wrote is very small, again we will improve this in the exercises.

** Exercises

=outputtemplate= is another internal variable. It controls the filenames (including file extensions) of MetaPost output. 
By default =outputtemplate= is set to "%j.%c".
Here =%j= referes to the input filename and =%c= to the figure number. 
=hppp= and =vppp= are another two internal variables, they control the resolution of the png output by setting hoirzontal/vertical points pr. pixel which defaults to 1. 
Having fewer points pr. pixel make images larger.

Experiment with setting these three variables to produced a png output with the .png file extension and a higher resolution than "HelloWorld.1".

You can also experiment with producing svg and postscript output.
