** What is MetaPost?
MetaPost is a 2D-graphics description language for specifying vector graphics.
It is also a piece of software, the MetaPost compiler, that renders such a specification to image files.

MetaPost is especially suited for describing graphics in a mathematical way and has a powerful build in
equation solver that enables this.

MetaPost is heavily inspired by the Metafont language, which was designed to define
fonts for TeX, and Metapost is often used in integration with LaTeX, but in this course we will
focus on using MetaPost as stand-alone software.

** What is learnMetaPost.com?
This course covers the basics of installing and using MetaPost. After completing the course you will be able to 
produce advanced graphics with MetaPost. There are plenty of features of metapost we will not cover, for a full
reference on all the features of MetaPost, see the excellent [[https://www.tug.org/docs/metapost/mpman.pdf][Manual]].
