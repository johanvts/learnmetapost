* What is MetaPost?

MetaPost is a programming language for specifying 2D vector graphics.
It is also a piece of software, the MetaPost compiler, that renders such a specification to image files.
MetaPost is especially well suited for describing graphics in a mathematical way and has a powerful build in
equation solver that enables this. MetaPost is heavily inspired by the Metafont language, which was designed to define
fonts for TeX, and Metapost is often used in integration with various TeX engines.
